# Navigating File Directories and Creating an R Project
Let's get RStudio up and running and discuss some of its features. Launch RStudio on your machine.

## R Studio - Your Favorite R IDE
The image below should look close to what you have when you launch RStudio. The `Console` command line is on the left, the `Environment` windows upper left and the `Navigator` tabs in lower left. This configuration can be modified later.
If you like the dark theme, you can set it by going to `Tools` > `Global Options` > `Appearance` > and set `Theme` to `Modern`.

## Create an R Project
Creating an R Project is the best way to start any R undertaking.

* Navigate from R Studio and create a folder for this class called `LearnR` on your C drive or in My Documents.
* Use File > New Project... > Project in Existing Directory to create a project called `LearnR.Rproj` in your `LearnR` directory.

## Create an R Script
* Evertyhing in R is `Case-Sensitive`
* Use a `.R` script file for your work, and use the `Console` for intermittent actions.
* Use `Shift + Ctrl + N` to open a new blank scripting window. Or File > New File > R Script.
* Save this file as `Lesson_1`.

# Basic R Commands
We will begin with basic R commands for understanding your programming environment and then move on to some examples of data types and basic manipulation.

## Checking out the Environment

* get(wd) - Displays the working directory, where R will read from and write to.
* sessionInfo() - Displays R version, and attached `packages`

Try the following commands in your scripting window. Use `Ctrl + Enter` to run a line of code in the script window.

```{r brc, results='hide'}

#Check working directory
getwd()

#Check out session info
sessionInfo()

```


## R Objects and Classes
Now let's look at R's ability to vreate objects in memory and our ability to use and manipulate them.

### Vectors
A vector is a `string` of numbers or text, or both. Mixed vectors of numbers and text will be stored as text.

Make a vector and assign it to an object using the `<-` operator and the "concatenate" `c()` operator. Then check the class of your vector using the `class()` operator, and its attributes using the `str()` operator.

```{r vec, results='markup'}
#Make a vector into memory
myVecN<-c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)
myVecN

#Check its class
class(myVecN)

#Check its other attributes
str(myVecN)

myVecL<-c('one','two','three','four','five','six')
class(myVecL)
str(myVecL)

#Remove the objects with rm()
rm(myVecN,myVecL)

```

R is a `vectorized` programming language meaning it can perform calculations on every object in a vector at once:

![](./img/vector.png)

Multiply two vectors together.

```{r vecs}
v1<-c(2,4,6,8,10)
v2<-c(1,1,2,2,0.5)
v1*v2
v1/v2

```


### Lists

Create a list and explore its features.

* Select certain objects from the list

### Data Frames

Create a data frame and explore its features

* Check data frame dimensions
* Check column names

### Factors

Understand what a factor is, and when to use it or not use it.

## R Data Sets
R and R packages have built-in data sets for practicing and developing your R code. We will explore the `iris` dataset and see some examples of data manipulation.

You can view available data sets with the `data()` function. Try that now.

### Load the Iris Data Set into Memory

* Learn about the data set form the help menu `help()`
* Load the data frame
* Check out the data frame (`head()`, `tail()`, `names()`, `dim()`)
* Subset the data frame (`[,]`)
* Filter the data frame (`subset()`)
* Rename columns (`$`,`colnames`)
* Create a new column (`$`)

```{r iris1}
#Load the iris data set to an object called myDF
myDF<-iris

#Check out the documentation for the iris data set
help(iris)

#Check out the df
dim(myDF)
#Check out the structure and attributes
str(myDF)
#Check out the first 10 records
head(myDF,10)
#Check out the last 5 records
tail(myDF,5)
#Check out the column names
names(myDF)

#Rename a column
colnames(myDF)[5]<-'SPECIES'

#Rename all columns
names(myDF)
names(myDF)<-c('SP_LENGTH','SP_WIDTH','PTL_LENGTH','PTL_WIDTH','SPECIES')
names(myDF)

```


### Calculate a summary of the Iris data

* Summarize the data in the `iris` data frame.

```{r irissumm}
summary(myDF)

```


### Plot the Iris Data

* Use the `plot()` function.
* Use the `boxplot()` function.

**Scatterplot**

```{r plotiris}
plot(myDF$SP_LENGTH~myDF$SP_WIDTH, col = myDF$SPECIES)

```

**Boxplot of Petal Length**

```{r bplotiris}
boxplot(myDF$PTL_LENGTH~myDF$SPECIES, xlab='Species',ylab='Petal Length (in)')

```


# Exercises

## Old Faithful Geyser Data

Perform the following exercises with the Old Faitful data set in your Lesson 1 script so you have the code for reference. Use `help(faithful)` in the console to bring up info about the data set. You can reveal the code and results with the buttons below.

1. Load the `faithful` data set and assign it to an object called `faithful`. Use `head()` to check the object.

<div class="fold s o">

```{r faithful1}
faithful<-faithful
head(faithful)

```


</div>


2. Check out the attributes and dimensions of the data set with `dim()` and `str()`.

<div class="fold s o">

```{r faithful2}

dim(faithful)
str(faithful)

```


</div>

3. Summarize the columns of the data frame columns with `summary()`.

<div class="fold s o">

```{r faithful3}
summary(faithful)

```


</div>

4. Plot waiting time on the x axis and eruptions on the y axis using the `plot()` function.

<div class="fold s o">

```{r faithful4}

plot(faithful$eruptions~faithful$waiting)

```


</div>
