# Navigating File Directories and Creating an R Project
Let's get R Studio up and running and discuss some of its features. Launch R Studio on your machine.

## R Studio - Your Favorite R IDE
The image below should look close to what you have when you launch R Studio. The `Console` command line is on the left, the `Environment` windows upper left and the `Navigator and Preview` tabs in lower right. This configuration can be modified later.

If you like the dark theme, you can set it by going to `Tools` > `Global Options` > `Appearance` > and set `Theme` to `Modern`.

## Create an R Project
Creating an R Project is the best way to start any R undertaking.

* Navigate from R Studio and create a folder for this class called `LearnR` on your C drive or in My Documents.
* Use File > New Project... > Project in Existing Directory to create a project called `LearnR.Rproj` in your `LearnR` directory.

## Create an R Script
* Everything in R is `Case-Sensitive`
* Use a `.R` script file for your work, and use the `Console` for intermittent actions.
* Use `Shift + Ctrl + N` to open a new blank scripting window. Or File > New File > R Script.
* Save this file as `Lesson_1`.

# Basic R Commands
We will begin with basic R commands for understanding your programming environment and then move on to some examples of data types and basic manipulation.

## Checking out the Environment

* get(wd) - Displays the working directory, where R will read from and write to.
* sessionInfo() - Displays R version, and attached `packages`

Try the following commands in your scripting window. Use `Ctrl + Enter` to run a line of code in the script window.

```{r brc, results='hide'}

#Check working directory
getwd()

#Check out session info
sessionInfo()

```


## R Objects and Classes
Now let's look at R's ability to create objects in memory and our ability to use and manipulate them.

### Vectors
A vector is a `string` of numbers or text, or both. Mixed vectors of numbers and text will be stored as text.

Make a vector and assign it to an object using the `<-` operator and the "concatenate" `c()` operator. Then check the class of your vector using the `class()` operator, and its attributes using the `str()` operator.

```{r vec, results='markup'}
#Make a vector into memory
myVecN<-c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)
myVecN

#Check its class
class(myVecN)

#Check its other attributes
str(myVecN)

myVecL<-c('one','two','three','four','five','six')
class(myVecL)
str(myVecL)

#Remove the objects with rm()
rm(myVecN,myVecL)

```

R is a `vectorized` programming language meaning it can perform calculations on every object in a vector at once:

![](./img/vector.png)

Multiply two vectors together.

```{r vecs}
v1<-c(2,4,6,8,10)
v2<-c(1,1,2,2,0.5)
v1*v2
v1/v2

```


### Lists

Create a list and explore its features.

* Select certain objects from the list

### Data Frames

Create a data frame and explore its features

* Check data frame dimensions
* Check column names

### Factors

Understand what a factor is, and when to use it or not use it.

## R Data Sets
R and R packages have built-in data sets for practicing and developing your R code. We will explore the `iris` data set and see some examples of data manipulation.

You can view available data sets with the `data()` function. Try that now.

### Load the Iris Data Set into Memory and Check out the Data

* Learn about the data set form the help menu `help()`
* Load the data frame
* Check out the data frame (`head()`, `tail()`, `names()`, `dim()`, `unique()`,`table()`)
* Subset the data frame (`[,]`)
* Rename columns (`$`,`colnames`)
* Create a new column (`$`)

You can view details about a `data set` with the `help()` or `?` functions. Try running `help(iris)` or `?iris` in the console now.

```{r iris1}
#Load the iris data set to an object called myDF
myDF<-iris
#Check out the df
dim(myDF)
#Check out the structure and attributes
str(myDF)
#Check out the first 10 records
head(myDF,10)
#Check out the last 5 records
tail(myDF,5)
#Checkout the unique values in the 'Species' column
unique(myDF$Species)
#Check out how many of each
table(myDF$Species)
#Subset just some columns and rows [rows index, columns index]
myDF[c(1:5),c(5,1)]
#Filter based on column values
setosa<-myDF[myDF$Species == 'setosa',] #The logical operator '==' is used to declare equivalency

dim(setosa)

head(setosa)
#Check out the column names
names(myDF)
#Rename a column
colnames(myDF)[5]<-'SPECIES'
#Rename all columns
names(myDF)
names(myDF)<-c('SP_LENGTH','SP_WIDTH','PTL_LENGTH','PTL_WIDTH','SPECIES')
names(myDF)
```


### Calculate a summary of the Iris data

* Summarize the data in the `iris` data frame.

```{r irissumm}
summary(myDF)

```


### Plot the Iris Data

* Use the `plot()` function and the `lm()` function.
* Use the `boxplot()` function.
* Use the `hist()` function.
* Use the `qqnorm()` function.

**Scatterplot**

```{r plotiris}

plot(myDF$SP_LENGTH~myDF$SP_WIDTH, col = myDF$SPECIES)

```

**Scatterplot with Best Fit Line**
Make a linear model of the data with `lm()` and assign it to an object `mdl`, then add it to the plot.

```{r plotiris2}
#Make linear model with lm() and assign it to an object 
mdl<-lm(myDF$SP_LENGTH~myDF$SP_WIDTH)
summary(mdl)

plot(myDF$SP_LENGTH~myDF$SP_WIDTH, col = myDF$SPECIES)
abline(mdl)

```


**Boxplot of Petal Length**

```{r bplotiris}
boxplot(myDF$PTL_LENGTH~myDF$SPECIES, xlab='Species',ylab='Petal Length (in)')

```

**Histogram of Petal Length Values**

```{r hist}
hist(myDF$PTL_LENGTH)
```

**Quantile Plot of Petal Length Values Colored by Species**

```{r q}
qqnorm(myDF$PTL_LENGTH,col=myDF$SPECIES)

```

# Exercises

## Old Faithful Geyser Data

Perform the following exercises with the Old Faithful data set in your Lesson 1 script so you have the code for reference. Use `help(faithful)` in the console to bring up info about the data set. You can reveal the code and results with the buttons below, but try without the hints first.

1. Load the `faithful` data set and assign it to an object called `faithful`. Use `head()` to check the object.

<div class="fold s o">

```{r faithful1}
faithful<-faithful
head(faithful)

```


</div>


2. Check out the attributes and dimensions of the data set with `dim()` and `str()`.

<div class="fold s o">

```{r faithful2}

dim(faithful)
str(faithful)

```


</div>

3. Summarize the columns of the data frame columns with `summary()`.

<div class="fold s o">

```{r faithful3}
summary(faithful)

```


</div>

4. Make a linear model and scatter plot of waiting time on the x axis and eruptions on the y axis using the `plot()` and `lm()` and `abline()` functions. Is there a relationship between wait time and the length of eruption?

<div class="fold s o">

```{r faithful4}
mdl<-lm(faithful$eruptions~faithful$waiting)
summary(mdl)
plot(faithful$eruptions~faithful$waiting)
abline(mdl)

```


</div>


## Motor Trend Cars Data Set
Perform the following exercises with the Motor Trend `mtcars` data set in your Lesson 1 script so you have the code for reference. Use `?(mtcars)` in the console to bring up info about the data set. You can reveal the code and results with the buttons below, but try without the hints first.

1. Load the `mtcars` data set and assign it to an object called `cars`.

<div class="fold s o">

```{r cars1}
cars<-mtcars
head(cars,10)
```

</div>

2. Select out just the variables `mpg` and `wt` and assign it to a new data frame called `carsMPG` 

<div class="fold s o">

```{r cars2}
names(cars)
carsMPG<-cars[,c(1,6)]
head(carsMPG)

```


</div>

3. Make a linear model and scatter plot with best-fit line of the `carsMPG` data frame of weight on the x axis and miles per gallon on the y axis. Is there a relationship between weight and mpg?

<div class="fold s o">

```{r cars3}
mdl<-lm(carsMPG$mpg~carsMPG$wt)
summary(mdl)
plot(carsMPG$mpg~carsMPG$wt)
abline(mdl)

```


</div>


4. Make a summary table from `cars` of miles per gallon and number of cylinders. Use the `table()` function.

<div class="fold s o">

```{r cars4}
table(cars$gear,cars$cyl)

```


</div>
