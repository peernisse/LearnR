title: "Learn R!"
---

This class will consist of 6-8 two-hour session held Friday mornings at 8. We will hold it in a conference room in SLC office, and by Skype.

`R` is one of the most popular programming languages for statistical computing in the science world along with `Python`.

Use the navigation bar at the top to find out more information and view lessons for this course.

I look forward to going through this course. We have several folks in the class who already use R so there should be a lot to learn!

# Why R, or any Programming Language, Really?
There are many reasons why learning to do your work in R or another programming language `python?` is the way to go. Minimize all those copies of copies of Excel files on your project, and you will never look back!

There are many options for doing analysis in a programming language, but this class is all about R!

Excel does not appear in this plot...

9. Easier to find and fix errors
9. It's free and open source
10. Advanced Statistics capabilities

# Prerequesites for this Class

You need only a desire to improve your data handling and analysis skills and a few installs of software on your computer!


### Installs
The following steps will set you up for the class. You will need to download the `.exe` installation files somewhere on your hard drive, then call IT to have them run the installs. **IT Number** 1-866-257-5984. Do not use the online IT services request, just call them.


1. Download the R programming language, if you have not already. Download the version for Windows and put it somewhere  you can find on your computer (e.g., My Documents). Have IT install it.

[Download R](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/3.4.4/){target="_blank"}

2. Download R Studio, the preferred integrated development environment (IDE) for R. Download the version for Windows and put it somewhere  you can find on your computer (e.g., My Documents). Select the **FREE** version to download. Have IT install it.

3. **OPTIONAL.  **Download GIT, a popular file version control software for programming. Download the Windows version and put it somewhere you can find on your computer (e.g., My Documents). Have IT install it.

[Download GIT for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads){target="_blank"}

**When installing GIT, just follow all default installation options.**

Then, configure your username an email. This can also be changed later if you are having trouble.

`Open GitBash command line from the Start menu and enter the following commands`

`git config --global --user.name "the name you want to have GIT record you as"`

`git config --global --user.email "your email"`
